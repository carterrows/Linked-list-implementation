Implementation:

My implementation is fully functional. My command line parser works and correctly identifies the command line arguments.
My code for the "updateWordInTallyList" function works as expected, adding new words to the correct list, and incrementing the counter for word counts.

When the program is run with a valid file input, the output is as expected.
All of the command line flags such as "shouldPrintData" and setting specific hapax lengths work as expected.

When ran with valgrind, the output is as expected, no memory leaks are possible.
